		More than 100 companies have been acquired by computer software and web search engine company Google. On average, Google has acquired more than one company per week since 2010. Google's largest acquisition was the purchase of Motorola Mobility, a mobile device manufacturing company, for $12.5 billion. Like Google itself, most of the firms acquired by Google are based in the United States, and, in turn, most of these are based in or around the San Francisco Bay Area. Many Google products originated as services provided by companies that Google has since acquired. For example, Google's first acquisition was the Usenet company Deja News, and its services became Google Groups. Similarly, Google acquired Dodgeball, a social networking service company, and eventually replaced it with Google Latitude. Other acquisitions include web application company JotSpot, which became Google Sites; Voice over IP company GrandCentral, which became Google Voice; and video hosting service company Next New Networks, which became YouTube Next Lab and Audience Development Group.
